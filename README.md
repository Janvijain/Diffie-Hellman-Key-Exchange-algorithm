# Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange-algorithm               
The Diffie–Hellman (DH) Algorithm is a key-exchange protocol that enables two parties communicating over public channel to establish a mutual secret without it being transmitted over the Internet. DH enables the two to use a public key to encrypt and decrypt their conversation or data using symmetric cryptography. Diffie–Hellman key exchange establishes a shared secret between two parties that can be used for secret communication for exchanging data over a public network.                  

This Code calculates the key and sends email from Alice to Bob & Bob to Alice                    
This code successfully sends key in emails                     

Update this emails in the code               
Alice's email = alice_email                    
Bob's_email = bob_email
